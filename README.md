# (As) Easy As Py

Python notes

## Objective 1

Time series plots

- for few countries (US, China, India, Turkey, Lebanon)
- total cases, number of deaths in same graph

## Assignment C (2020-05-24)

### Main assignment 

- From the time series data, find sum of all confirmed cases and confirmed deaths from all provinces of China (excluding Wuhan); from start of infection to today's date
- Now compare the following:
	- total sum of confirmed cases to date: Wuhan vs. Rest of China
	- total sum of deaths to date: Wuhan vs. Rest of China

### Auxiliary stuff

- Learn to stop and start jupyter
- Store a single script, (say `assignment_b.py`) that records your solution for the previous assignment. We will use it to keep an archive of all your learning -- for your easy reference later. 

## Assignment B (2020-05-20)

### Main assignment

- Read the two data files as pandas data.frames and then
    - print out the first 5 rows of each
    - print out the first 5 rows and first 5 columns of each
    - subselect the rows and columns corresponding to India, Turkey for the first 15 days of April
    
### Auxiliary stuff
- Make an account on github.com and then try to make changes directly on this document (I will need to add you as a collaborator once you have a github account)
- Make notes for the process of stopping and starting Jupyter on your Mac, saving notebooks (ipynb documents) and reopening them

## Assignment A
  
- Assignment A1
	- Explore this data repository https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 to find the CSV / TSV file that is most suited for objective 1

	https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv

- Assignment A2
	- Go to http://localhost:8888/lab on Chrome, and have the computer type out "Never stop learning"
	- Tip: Python3 has a "print" command
